# The Mogo Interview Candidate Experience Extraordinaire!

First, thank you for wanting to work with us and for lending us your time to work through this exercise.

We've tried hard to model these exercises after normal work you'll expect to perform on the job.  The hope is that this exercise will be a two-way street, and we'll both get a sense of whether we're a good fit for each other.

## Rules of Engagement

1. You have 1hr to finish as much of these scenarios as you can.
2. You can use whatever tools you normally use in your day-to-day. Yes that means
   chatgpt/claude or whatever AI tool you normally use. But we will be asking 
   in-depth follow up questions on why certain decisions would be made.

## Exercises

There are three exercises, one each on Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform. You'll
find a `README.md` file in each with a handful of tasks and questions. You do not need to finish everything - just do what you can and focus on your strengths.

## Question and Answers

Some exercises have questions inside the `README.md` files.  To make it clear when we're actually asking you a question (as opposed to being rhetorical), we've included places for you to answer inline.  If you see this, then add your answer directly in the file:

> Answer:

> Put your answer here.

## Handing it in

When you're finished, send us a tarball of this entire directory and email it back to us.

## Feedback

We're continually improving this interview process, attempting to make something practical and objective in the hopes of avoiding our unconscious biases.

To that end, **please send us any feedback you have on how we can improve this process.**
